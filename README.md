## 🧑‍💻 Professional Experience

### 🎮 Unity Game Developer — Edurino GmbH (2023–2025)
At Edurino, I developed several educational minigames totaling around 30 minutes of gameplay each. I collaborated closely with game designers, content creators, artists, and tech artists. Beyond implementation, I helped streamline pipelines, introduced a low-code workflow tailored to our needs, integrated content into existing codebases, and refactored legacy systems. I also supported onboarding of new developers.

### 🧩 Software Developer — ENKO Software GmbH & Co. KG (2020–2023)
Initially led the redevelopment of a mobile game project. Later, I became lead developer in a five-person team tasked with customizing Microsoft Business Central for local clients. My responsibilities included migrating business processes from Excel to Business Central, development in AL, and setting up DevOps workflows using Git and Docker. I also trained colleagues and mentored a trainee.

### 🎓 Developer & Team Lead — Student Projects (2015–2019)
During my studies, I participated in and led various software projects. Roles varied between team leadership and development. One of the highlights was my bachelor thesis, where I created a 2D ecosystem simulation with AI agents using the NEAT algorithm in Unity.

## 🧪 Projects

### [Stubbi-Car (2020)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stubbi-car-das-game/id1508323525)
A side-scrolling one-tap game developed for Bitburger. I was the sole developer responsible for the full technical implementation.

I developed the complete game loop and implemented a customizable car system with varying physics depending on the vehicle's state. The game features multiple interactive item types, quick time event mechanics, an online high score system, ghost driving, and full account handling with persistent data. I also built a scrolling and unlockable world map, added multi-touch support, and handled the porting process to both Android and iOS platforms.

Bachelor thesis project: A 2D autonomous ecosystem with NEAT-based self-learning AI. Includes procedural generation and early Unity DOTS use.

### [Edurino Minigames (2023–2025)](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/edurino/id1576678420)
A collection of educational minigames designed for children. I contributed as the main Unity developer on multiple titles, covering approx. 30 minutes of interactive gameplay each. These projects involved close collaboration with designers and artists, system integration, and workflow automation.
